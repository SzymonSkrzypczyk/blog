# About the page
The page has been created as a result of my recent interest in laravel framework and as a mean to share my knowledge and experiences
with others, mostly about different edge cases and solutions that I have encountered during my professional career, but also on some of my personal projects.

# Why laravel?
My first contact with laravel came as a result of a project for one of my courses at the university. Even though before that I had been skeptical towards PHP I was amazed by 
the simplicity and the power of the framework and decided to give it a go for my personal use case.

# Stack
The page is built using **Laravel framework**, along with some additional packages, used for example for generating HTML from markdown and **Filament**, which I used 
to create an admin panel for managing the content of the page. On the frontend side, I used **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **React with Inertia.js** for the interactivity and layout of the page.

# How to access the page?
